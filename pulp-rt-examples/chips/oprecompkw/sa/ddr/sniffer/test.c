/*
 * This example shows how a RISC-V core can use the DMA engine from within a
 * PULP cluster to access an external memory (e.g., DDRx-SDRAM, with via the
 * SoC interconnect through the DDRx-SDRAM memory controller.
 *
 * In this example the RISC-V core generates multiple read requests to the DMA
 * engine with size 4 KiB. The first request addresses the external memory
 * base address, then the address is incremented by 1MiB each time until it
 * reaches 256MiB from the base. The collected data is formatted and dumped to
 * the standard output.
